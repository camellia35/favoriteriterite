<p style="45px">Because I could not stop for Death –
<br>He kindly stopped for me –
<br>The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
<br>And Immortality.</p>

<p>We slowly drove – He knew no haste
<br>And I had put away
<br>My labor and my leisure too,
<br>For His Civility – </p>

<p>We passed the School, where Children strove
<br>At Recess – in the Ring –
<br>We passed the Fields of Gazing Grain –
<br>We passed the Setting Sun – </p>

<p>Or rather – He passed us –
<br>The Dews drew quivering and chill –
<br>For only Gossamer, my Gown –
<br>My Tippet – only Tulle – </p>

<p>We paused before a House that seemed
<br>A Swelling of the Ground –
<br>The Roof was scarcely visible –
<br>The Cornice – in the Ground – </p>

<p>Since then – ‘tis Centuries – and yet
<br>Feels shorter than the Day
<br>I first surmised the Horses’ Heads
<br>Were toward Eternity – </p>
